name: NWB Packaging Subject
description: This specialized capsule is designed to create a base NWB file including
  metadata related to the institute and subject. This should serve as the foundation
  used by capsules further downstreams as they create their own intermediary NWB files.
  By including this subject metadata in each of the NWB files, they should pass Dandi
  and NWB validation criteria. The package queries the AIND Data Assets using the
  subject id, date of the session, and the physiology type of the sessions.
